"Knuckles Restaurant Pos System" is a standalone application that enables you to provide an efficient self-service point of sale (POS system). It is designed to handle a minimum number of employees. The interaction between the system and the customer is maximized. Customers can set up tables and order groceries using the automated menu. Once the user has ordered a kitchen, he gets the order details. The user will be notified by email when the order is ready.


How our system addresses the shortcomings of a traditional system
Many POS systems currently in use in Sri Lanka require operators. This requires a lot of labor and is expensive. To solve this, we have created a POS system that enables self-service.

This system manually addresses many currents in operating systems.

We have developed an automated POS system that allows customers to order and pay quickly without having to wait for a cashier to remove it.

If there are cashier people in the traditional system, customers have to wait in line to place an order or pay the bills. This is mainly due to the fact that operators have to be paid for, and restaurants typically employ only a few employees. Since our system does not require labor to run the system, a restaurant can easily place multiple computers (with touch screen interfaces) so that customers do not have to line up even during rush hours.

Unlike the traditional way where customers have to wait until a waiter arrives, if the restaurant is busy, the above delay is because everything in our system (ordering and paying) is done by the customer himself. Avoid.

The only delay that can occur is waiting for the kitchen order to be executed. The self-service capability allows the restaurant to prepare real-time meals and serve fresh food to customers.
